# Cross-Dataset HVG Alignment Test Results

## Test Date: July 28, 2025

### Overview
Successfully implemented and tested cross-dataset HVG alignment to fix the critical issue where pretraining and fine-tuning were using different gene indices.

### Key Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: scRNA data used Ensembl IDs (ENSG format) while VCC used gene symbols
- **Solution**: Updated `compute_cross_dataset_hvgs.py` to use Ensembl IDs from VCC's `gene_id` column for matching

### Test Results

#### 1. Cross-Dataset HVG Computation ✅
```
Total HVGs selected: 2000
Perturbed genes included: 150 (all of them!)
Genes common to both datasets: 18080
Genes only in scRNA: 18521
Genes only in VCC: 0
Mean dispersion of HVGs: 71.66
Mean % cells expressing HVGs: 25.58%
```

#### 2. ScRNA Dataset Loading ✅
- Successfully loaded 113,224 cells
- Correctly mapped 2000 genes from original 36,601 to HVG space
- Gene names: ['CFH', 'ANKIB1', 'CYP51A1', 'TMEM176A', 'CYP26B1', ...]

#### 3. VCC Dataset Loading ✅
- Successfully loaded with HVG filtering
- Gene names match exactly with ScRNA dataset
- Proper integration with existing VCC caching system

#### 4. Gene Index Alignment ✅
- ScRNA and VCC both use 2000 HVG genes
- Gene indices are identical between datasets:
  - ACTB: index 158 in both
  - CD3E: index 1812 in both
  - CD8A: index 1118 in both
  - MS4A1: index 1152 in both

#### 5. Model Integration ✅
- All imports successful
- Model creation works with 2000 genes
- Dataloaders properly configured

### Files Created/Updated

1. **New Files**:
   - `scripts/compute_cross_dataset_hvgs.py` - Main script for cross-dataset HVG computation
   - `dataset/scrna_hvg_dataset.py` - New dataset class for scRNA with HVG remapping
   - `docs/cross_dataset_hvgs.md` - Documentation explaining the issue and solution

2. **Updated Files**:
   - `train_st_conditional_diffusion.py` - Uses cross-dataset HVGs for pretraining
   - `train_transformer.py` - Updated to use cross-dataset HVGs
   - `dataset/__init__.py` - Added new dataset imports
   - `README.md` - Added critical setup instructions

3. **Generated Files**:
   - `data/vcc_data/cross_dataset_hvg_info.json` - Main HVG mapping file
   - `data/vcc_data/hvg_info.json` - VCC-compatible HVG info (updated)

### Key Benefits

1. **Transfer Learning Works**: Gene embeddings from pretraining are now meaningful during fine-tuning
2. **All Perturbation Targets Included**: All 150 perturbed genes are in the HVG set
3. **Efficient Memory Usage**: Only 2000 genes instead of 36,601
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Existing VCC code continues to work

### Usage Instructions

Before training, users must run:
```bash
python scripts/compute_cross_dataset_hvgs.py \
    --scrna-dir data/scRNA_1e5/processed \
    --vcc-path data/vcc_data/adata_Training.h5ad \
    --output-dir data/vcc_data
```

### Conclusion

The cross-dataset HVG alignment is working correctly. The critical bug that prevented effective transfer learning has been fixed. Both pretraining and fine-tuning phases now use identical gene indices, enabling the model to leverage knowledge learned during pretraining.
